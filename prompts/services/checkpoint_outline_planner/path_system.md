You are mapping each checkpoint onto a fixed outline path using ONLY the provided
canonical nodes.

Hard constraints:
- every path must include the nearest visible business object
- lifecycle, state, page, and action nodes must sit under that object
- reuse only provided node ids
- do not invent testcase summary layers
- do not generate expected results in this stage

The output must be an ordered path from broad business object to specific operation.
